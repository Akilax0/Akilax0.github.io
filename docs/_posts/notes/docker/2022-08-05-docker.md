# 328 Lecture

## Docker

- A leading software container platform
- A set of platform as service product that use **OS-level virtualization** to deliver software in package called containers.
- A tool designed to easier deploy in **docker host** and run apps by using **containers**(from **docker images**)
- Allows developer to package up an application with all the dependencies.

### OS level virtualization

OS allows one or more isolated user space instances —> containers

Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software.

Docker hub —> standard repo / registry

### Pros and Cons

Low resources 

faster startup 

Less traditional 

![image](/assets/notes/docker/Untitled3.png)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt intall docker 
```

[https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/)

Verify Installation 

Run Docker 

```bash
docker info
docker ps
```

Getting started 

Create dockerfile

text documetn containing commands to assemble custom docker image

Generate Docker image (docker build)

Execute the Image

Running an instance of the image 

- pull image from docker hub
    
    ```bash
    docker pull nginx
    ```
    
- Check images
    
    ```bash
    docker images
    ```
    
- Check containers
    
    ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```
    
- Run docker container
    
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name mycon01 nginx
    ```
    
- Check locally running instance
    
    http://localhist:8080
    

Port Binding

Default docker containers make connections to the outside world but the outside world cannot connect to containers

Attatched and Detached Mode

If you want to see all the output of the container, you can use default attach mode

can’t execute any commands , if terminal is attatched with the container

Press(Ctrl+c ) to exit the container

Detached mode

Can run commands if terminal is detached with container

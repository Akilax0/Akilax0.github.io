description: "The vehicle number plate is the unique identifier for every vehicle in Sri Lanka. Number plate identification
is very important for various purposes such as traffic statistics, identification of traffic law violations,
identification of criminals' vehicles, identification of fake number plates, etc. Automating such a system is
a really challenging task due to different reasons. In the image acquisition step, a lot of undesired noise,
lighting issues, and blurring effects are introduced to the image due to these images being acquired from
CCTV cameras under non-ideal conditions. "
